Create a persistent entity to store _Hotel_ entities. Most common way to handle persistence in Grails is the use of https://docs.grails.org/latest/ref/Domain%20Classes/Usage.html[Grails Domain Classes]:

include::{commondir}/common-quoteDomainClass.adoc[]

[source,bash]
----
./grailsw create-domain-class Hotel
CONFIGURE SUCCESSFUL

| Created grails-app/domain/demo/Hotel.groovy
| Created src/test/groovy/demo/HotelSpec.groovy
----

The `Hotel` domain class is our data model. We define different properties to store the `Hotel` characteristics.

[source,javascript]
./grails-app/domain/demo/Hotel.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/domain/demo/Hotel.groovy[indent=0]
----

We define multiple https://docs.grails.org/latest/ref/Constraints/Usage.html[validation constraints]

____
Constraints provide Grails with a declarative DSL for defining validation rules, schema generation and CRUD generation meta data.
____

Grails comes with multiple constraints ready to use:
